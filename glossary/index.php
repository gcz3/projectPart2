      <h4 class="section-title">Frame Data Table Explanation</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        A unit is considered to be 1 frame. This is 1/60th of a second
        (16.667ms) where the game processes the input, decides what to do, and
        displays it to the screen in this 1 frame unit. (60 frames per second).

        <br><br>

        <span class="term">Startup:</span>
        the amount of frames it takes from the time you pressed a button to when
        a move initiates to the first active (hitting) frame

        <br><br>

        <span class="term">Block Advantage:</span>
        how many frames until you can move compared to your opponent in the
        situation that your attack is blocked. A number with a '+' before it
        means how many frames faster than your opponent you will recover. A
        number with a '-' before it means how much faster your opponent will
        recover. &plusmn0 means that you and the opponent recover at the same
        time and are even.

        <br><br>

        <span class="term">Invincibility:</span>
        any kind of move that has any type of invincible frames. The various
        types:

        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">full :</span>
        completely invincible to everything
        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">head :</span>
        invincible against jump attacks type moves
        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">throw :</span>
        invincible only to throws
        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">phys :</span>
        invincible only to physical attacks
        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">leg :</span>
        invincible only to low attacks
        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">proj :</span>
        invincible only to projectiles

        <br><br>

        <span class="term">Damage:</span>
        the amount of damage done when an attack lands a hit

        <br><br>

        <span class="term">Total Frames:</span>
        the total amount of frames from the attack coming out until you are able
        to move again

        <br><br>

        <span class="term">Cancel Ability:</span>

        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">P :</span>
        possible to passing link (chaining normal attacks on hit or block)
        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">S :</span>
        possible to special cancel (on hit or block)
        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">E :</span>
        possible to EX cancel (on hit or block)
        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">C :</span>
        possible to CS cancel (on hit or block)
        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">&#9734 :</span>
        possible to CS cancel on hit or block or whiff
        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">&#9678 :</span>
        possible to EX cancel on hit or block or whiff

        <br><br>

        Some additional attacks can also even be performed when a normal attack
        is whiffed.

        <br><br>

        <span class="term">Freeze frames of a super flash:</span>
        the frames before the startup of an EX move, CS, IW, or IWI where both
        players are frozen

        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">EX :</span>
        20F
        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">CS :</span>
        40F
        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">IW :</span>
        60F
        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">IWI :</span>
        20F

        <br><br>

        Since super freeze is seen during the first frame, the advancing frame
        during the super freeze is 1F.

        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">Example 1 :</span>
        Hyde - Red Clad Craver EX - 1(20)+4 = Startup 5F
        <br>
        <span class="term sub-term">Example 2 :</span>
        Seth - Zaikyuu no Convict EX - 1(20)+5 = Startup 6F (25F including super
        freeze)

        <br><br>

        <span class="term version-change">Meaning of Orange Color:</span>
        <br>
        <span class="version-change">Represents changes from UNIEL to UNIEL[st]
          and UNIEL[st] ver.3.10</span>
      </p>

    <div class="well section">
      <h4 class="section-title">Attacks</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        Normal attacks A, B, and C can all be done standing, crouching, and
        jumping comprising 9 different moves. Inputting the joystick in
        different directions and doing an attack comprises character specific
        moves.
      </p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="well section">
      <h4 class="section-title">Throw</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        <span class="term">Startup:</span>
        4F

        <br><br>

        It is not possible to block a throw. If the player that is getting
        thrown inputs his or her own throw within a set amount of time, it is
        possible to tech the throw (break out of it). The player that gets his
        or her throw teched ends up at -8 (they can still block). If the player
        throws his or her opponent while they are blocking or getting hit, a
        yellow effect goes occurs during the throw. The popular name for this is
        yellow grab/throw. When a yellow grab is seen, the time to tech the
        throw is long.

        <br>

        Throwing an opponent within 7 frames after they block will cause a
        yellow grab.

        <br><br>

        <span class="term">Throw Tech:</span>
        If a throw lands, the player who got thrown will lose 2 blocks of GRD.
        In the case that the throw is teched, the player that initiated the
        throw will lose 2 blocks of GRD.
        <!-- TODO: Check how the yellow grab case actually works, in UNIEL, the
        rules are the same as a normal grab -->
        During a yellow grab, the player that initiated it will get an
        additional block of GRD when they touch the opponent and another block
        of GRD if the throw lands. After that, the same rules as a normal throw
        are followed.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="well section">
      <h4 class="section-title">Shield</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        A special block that is performed by pressing D while holding the
        joystick in a blocking direction (the D button can be held down). If you
        block an opponent's attack with this, you can recover/move faster than
        you normally would be able to. If you shield ground attacks, you recover
        three frames faster than normal. Although, the effects of shielding an
        air attack will depend on the type of attack, the opponent will not be
        able to cancel into anything until they land, and their landing recovery
        is increased.

        <br><br>

        On a suucessful shield, the player's EXS gauge decreases to increase the
        special gauge GRD. On a failed shield (whiff), the player's GRD gauge
        goes down. There is the concept of blocking high and low, and if the
        player is shielding in the wrong direction, the player's GRD gauge gets
        broken (GRD break).
      </p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="well section">
      <h4 class="section-title">Assault (Not possible while GRD broken)</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        A mini jump that is performed by holding the joystick forward and
        pressing D. If done while on the ground, the moment assault is inputted,
        wherever the opponent is at that time, the mini jump goes to them. While
        assaulting from the ground, the player can go into only one jump normal
        or air special move and cannot do any kind of cancel (but on hit, it is
        possible to chain shift (CS)). When doing assault from the air, the
        player will perform an air dash that goes a set distance, and unlike the
        ground version, the player can do more than one action.
      </p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="well section">
      <h4 class="section-title">Tech/Ukemi</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        <span class="term">How to get up after getting hit by an air combo or
          being knocked down:</span>
        hold down a button and a direction on the joystick (can leave the
        joystick in neutral. holding the joystick in a direction will make the
        character go that way)

        <br><br>

        For the ground version, there are neutral and backward ground techs,
        both of which are not punishable. The air version allows you to tech in
        three different directions: neutral, forward, or backwards. After air
        teching you are invulnerable and unable to act until you touch the
        ground, similar to a Street Fighter air reset.

        <br><br>

        While teching backwards allows you to create space between you and your
        opponent, your GRD gauge will go down a little bit.
