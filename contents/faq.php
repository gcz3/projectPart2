    <h1>Hello!</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to this site. This is a website that is built to allow players to
      look at frame data for all the characters in UNDER NIGHT IN-BIRTH
      Exe:Late[st], otherwise known as UNIEL[st] or simply UNIst.

      <br><br>

      This is the second part of this project. I have managed to add a lot with
      the main new addition being that all the frame data is stored in a
      database across various tables. However, as always, there is still more
      I could do to make this website much better (especially since I suck at
      design). orz
    </p>
