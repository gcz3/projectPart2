# projectPart2

This is my University of Pittsburgh CS 1520 Project Part 2.

## Overview

This is a website that I created that has frame data for all the characters in a fighting game titled *UNDER NIGHT IN-BIRTH Exe:Late[st]*.

The old Project Part 1 can be found ***[HERE](https://github.com/gcz3/projectPart1)***.

## Note

Obviously, with the frame data for each character coming from a database, if you fork this, when you try to click on a character's frame data page, an error message will appear and the table will not be filled out.

From here, you can either click the "Glossary" link or one of the "Home" links in the header navbar to change pages. Otherwise, you will just be stuck.

Similarly, the contact form will not submit properly without the proper database and table.
